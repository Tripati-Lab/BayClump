# `BayClump` Basics

`BayClump` version 0.9.2 was developed in `R` version 4.1.2 and `RStudio` version 1.4.1106. It has been tested up to `R` 4.2.1 and `RStudio` 2022.02.3+492. This app accompanies Román-Palacios et al. *under revision*: `BayClump`: Bayesian Calibration and Temperature Reconstructions for Clumped Isotope Thermometry. [Link](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10507995.2).

`BayClump` is separated into calibration and reconstruction workflows. Any calibration models selected on the Calibrations tab are automatically made available for use in the Reconstructions tab. At this time, only $Δ_{47}$-based calibrations and reconstructions are supported.
